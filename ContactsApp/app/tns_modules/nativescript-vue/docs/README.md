# Introduction

## What is [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)?

NativeScript is an open source framework for building truly native mobile application using JavaScript.

## What is [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

## What is NativeScript-Vue?

NativeScript-Vue is a NativeScript Plugin which allows you to use Vue.js to craft your mobile application.

If you have used Vue.js before you will feel at home with NativeScript-Vue.

## Why would you use this?

If you are in the position where you want to create mobile applications, and just found about NativeScript, but you don't want to use xml to write your layouts and pure javascript to handle all the logic, and you don't want to use Angular either, instead you want an easy to learn and fun way to write your applications, you might want to consider giving this a try, Vue.js is very enjoyable to work with.
